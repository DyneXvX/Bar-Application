## What is this for?

```
The University of North Florida
CIS-4327
IS Senior Project 1 / Bar Application Required Project
Due August 31 2020
```

## General Instructions

```
We are to build a web application that handles drink orders from the table. 
However, I have no clue how these work, I have never seen one in real life and to be honest.
I am not even sure allowing the customers to order drinks from their table is a good idea.
```

## General Build Guide

```
I have designed this to run with multiple accounts. 
1. The table the screen is at: Table 1 for this program
-- They only have access to a create order screen
2. The bartender. They need to build a bar menu for everyone to order from. (Plus I figure house specials or sales.)
--They also will have access to the full order screen for knowing what table ordered what
3. The Manager: Has control over the accounts 
-- Kind of like a admin
4. The general customer screen: 
--Just there before the server would log in and a way to show a standard index page.

Once again I have no clue how this works in the real world, I have never seen one.
This is my best attempt and a solid guess.

## Thank you
