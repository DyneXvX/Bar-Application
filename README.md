# Bar Application

## How to install

```
Download the full project and change the connection string to whatever you 
are using at home.
I built an initializer to run this for you so all you need to do is run(f5)
and it will build.

This is the Managers Account (You can add new ones later if you want)
Email: manager@outlook.com
password: Password123
```

## What is this for?

```
The University of North Florida
CIS-4327
IS Senior Project 1 / Bar Application Required Project
Due August 31 2020
```

## General Instructions

```
We are to build a web application that handles drink orders from the table. 
```

## General Build Guide

```
I have designed this to run with multiple accounts. 
1. The table the screen is at: Table 1 for this program
-- They only have access to a create order screen
2. The bartender. They need to build a bar menu for everyone to order from. 
(Plus I figure house specials or sales.)
--They also will have access to the full order screen for knowing what table ordered what
3. The Manager: Has control over the accounts 
-- Kind of like a admin
--Has their own menus as well as the ability to create new accounts for their employees..
4. The Server:
--Built so the waiter/waitress can log in the table when they start their shift.
--This way customer can use it.
5. The general customer screen: 
--Just there before the server would log in and a way to show a standard index page.
```

## General Notes about this

```
Ok with this you can place drink orders based on the bartenders menu. 
The Manager has access to all screens plus registration of new employees
The Bartender makes the Drink Menu and can see the Order Queue
The Server is just the log in setup for the program to run correctly with any features.
The Customer is just a simple screen with the bar picture and a login function.

You need to log in as the Manager first or nothing will work. 
Create your employees if you want.
Create your Menu if you want to test the order system
Create your Order from the main page.
See the queue in the Bartenders dropdown.
```

## Issues

```
Today while closing this out I came accross a weird issue where
when the manager registers a new employee that is already in the system,
it will seldom crash. (No error check somewhere..)
I was going to look into it, however due to the fact it 
is extra and not required anyways for this project I am not going to stress this 
unless I get free time in the next week.
```

## Thank you
