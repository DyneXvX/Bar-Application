# Bar Application

## How to install

```
Download the full project and change the connection string to whatever you 
are using at home.
I built an initializer to run this for you so all you need to do is run(f5)
and it will build.

This is the Managers Account (You can add new ones later if you want)
Email: manager@outlook.com
password: Password123
```

## What is this for?

```
The University of North Florida
CIS-4327
IS Senior Project 1 / Bar Application Required Project
Due August 31 2020
```

## General Instructions

```
We are to build a web application that handles drink orders from the table. 
However, I have no clue how these work, I have never seen one in real life and to be honest.
I am not even sure allowing the customers to order drinks from their table is a good idea.
```

## General Build Guide

```
I have designed this to run with multiple accounts. 
1. The table the screen is at: Table 1 for this program
-- They only have access to a create order screen
2. The bartender. They need to build a bar menu for everyone to order from. (Plus I figure house specials or sales.)
--They also will have access to the full order screen for knowing what table ordered what
3. The Manager: Has control over the accounts 
-- Kind of like a admin
--Has their own menus as well as the ability to create new accounts for their employees..
4. The general customer screen: 
--Just there before the server would log in and a way to show a standard index page.
5. The Server:
--Built so the waiter/waitress can log in the table when they start their shift.
--This way customer can use it.... I guess... Still sounds weird... but I built it anyways.
```

## General Notes about this

```
Ok with this you can place drink orders based on the bartenders menu. 
The bartenders menu is customizable. I figure drink sales and such plus what if that want to carry 
something new.
As of right now you can pick any number for your table during the order, becuase I have never
seen something like this in my life and this is my best attempt and a solid guess.
```

## Known Issue

```
If you try to create the same account twice it will crash. I have no been able to figure this out.
Has something to do with Manager selecting roles for the new acconts
However, this has nothing to do with the project I was suppose to build, I just wanted something more 
real and I couldn't figure out this one issue before I said I was done.
